# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses Python and machine learning techniques to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

---

## 📌 Objective
To build a predictive model that can forecast stock prices using features like Open, High, Low, Close prices and volume.

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** for data analysis and modeling
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data processing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model building (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- **CSV** for historical stock data

---

## 📁 Files
- `stock_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with EDA, model training, and predictions
- `stock_data.csv`: Historical stock data (optional)
- `model.pkl`: Trained model file (optional)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Download and clean historical stock data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends, moving averages, and volatility
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Predict future stock closing prices

---

## 🧠 Insights
- Trend and seasonality in stock prices
- Model accuracy and performance visualization
- Challenges in time series forecasting
